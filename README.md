# DANF

DANF (Dynamic Approximate Neighborhood Function) is an algorithm for 
continuously computing the approximate neighborhood function
for all nodes in a dynamic graph.

It is an extension to the [Webgraph framework](http://webgraph.di.unimi.it/).

DANF was created for our Master Thesis, Approximate neighborhood function 
on large dynamic graphs, in Computer Science at 
Chalmers University of Technology.

# Build and run
The project is built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
